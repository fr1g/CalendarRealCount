# CalendarRealCount
A Normal Way To Count Date As Real Life In Minecraft

### the crc.sk is the better one but no English sign inside. Careful XD

# Attention!
ALL DATE VARIABLES IN VER A WILL LOST!
PLEASE USE THE NEW FUNCTION TO MAKE YOUR DATE JUMPED CORRECTLY

for example:

if before, your date is 2022.2.20
After you updated to Ver B:

reload the script
<br>
execute command "/jtoDate"
<br>
send 2022 in chat
<br>
send 2 in chat
<br>
send 20 in chat
<br>
and then click the GO button
<br>
Done!
<br>
(only able in client.)
